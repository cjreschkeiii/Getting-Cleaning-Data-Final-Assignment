# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Final-Assignment
 Repo for the submission of the Final Course Assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. To aid in this analysis, the script run_analysis.R was created to do the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end result is shown in the file tidy_data.txt.

You can find additional information about the run_analysis.R scrpit in the CodeBook.MD file.
